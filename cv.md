## About Me
A year ago, I worked as a project manager at an online school. Delegated tasks and developed a biology project. But I wanted something more.


Now I am actively learning a new profession and developing my programming skills. I am a responsible and hardworking person as well as stubborn. 

My goal is to become a great developer and find a team with which we will create awesome projects!
